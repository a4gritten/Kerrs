                    <p>
                        Jim is our director and has been in the counseling business for over 35 years and man is he GOOD! 
                        Jim is the calm in the storm, the place to turn when you don't know what else to do. 
                        He can help people see the changes they need to see AND make them feel like they can make the changes too. 
                        Supportive, honest, upfront - he's a "tell you the truth" kind of guy that can help you learn to move mountains! 
                        Or maybe just move yourself when a bad case of inertia sets in. 
                        Quick witted and funny, our agency would not be the same without his leadership, skills, and compassion. 
                        If you don't know Jim, you should. 
                        He's just that kind of a guy.

                    <p>
                        Lynell is a licensed addiction counselor, but so much more. 
                        She has worked with Kerrs Counseling almost since we opened and during that time has done just about every job in the place. 
                        If you have any questions Lynell is the go to person. 
                        And if you need help she's also a great person to help you figure out your life. 
                        Lynell provides counseling, does alcohol/drug evaluations and does intake sessions. 
                        In addition she helps run the place and keep us all on our toes. 
                        Give her a call to set up an appointment. 
                        You'll be glad you did!

                    <p>
                        So let me introduce you to another staff at our agency, Jennifer Gold. 
                        Jennifer is technically a licensed addictions counselor, but she is actually a compassionate person who is always there to help. 
                        She is kind, caring and can put people at ease in the blink of an eye. 
                        Jennifer is in charge of the Intensive Outpatient Program and she does an amazing job of teaching people what they need to know about living clean and sober. 
                        Jennifer is also available for individual counseling appointments and does the alcohol/drug education classes.
                        Jennifer adds that "homey feel" to our agency that lets you come in, sit doen, and stay awhile.

                        Anne is the most recent addition to our staff. 
                        Anne is a KCPM, also known as a Kansas Certified Peer Mentor.
                        She's the lady who helps our clients connect with resources.
                        From finding the courage to attend their first 12 step meeting, to figuring their budget Anne is our lady.
                        If a client needs help figuring out how to access local services such as the food bank or applying for Medicaid, Anne is our person. 
                        Anne is out and about in the community making sure people have the assistance they need on their journey through sobriety. 
                        Generous, helpful, and knowledgeable Ann is always there to help. 
                        She has been a wonderful addition that offers such tremendous support.
                        Sometimes we wonder how we ever did it without her!
